# contour

Source code and data to recreate analyses reported in Savage, P. E., Tierney, A. T., & Patel, A. D. (2017). Global music recordings support the motor constraint hypothesis for human and avian song contour. Music Perception, 34(3), 327â€“334.

To run, download the .csv data files and run the analyses in R using the source code "Savage2017Contour.R"

Note that the numbers in the raw data refer to volume, track, and phrase number of the respective Garland Encyclopedia of World Music recordings (for metadata, see the "35SongMetadata" worksheet and/or https://www.pnas.org/doi/suppl/10.1073/pnas.1414495112/suppl_file/pnas.1414495112.sd01.xls). So, for example, "1.4.2.wav" refers to phrase 2 from recording 4 ("Vai Call to Prayer") from Volume 1 (Africa) of the Garland Encyclopedia of World Music companion recordings.
